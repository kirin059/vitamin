    <p style="margin-top:30px;"> <strong>Sources</strong><br>
    For the most part, <mark class="grey">vitamins are obtained from the diet, but some are acquired by other means</mark>: for example,
    <em>microorganisms in the gut flora produce vitamin K and biotin; and one form of vitamin D is synthesized
    in skin cells when they are exposed to a certain wavelength of ultraviolet light present in sunlight.</em><br>
    <mark class="grey">Humans can produce some vitamins from precursors they consume</mark>: for example, vitamin A is synthesized
    from beta carotene; and niacin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan.The Food Fortification
    Initiative lists countries which have mandatory fortification programs for vitamins folic acid, niacin,
    vitamin A and vitamins B1, B2 and B12</p>
    <p style="margin-top:30px;"> <strong>Deficient intake</strong><br>
    The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 are stored in significant
    amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months
    and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. <mark class="green">However, vitamin B3
    (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last only a couple of weeks.</mark>
    For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have
     varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.
    <br><br>
    Deficiencies of vitamins are classified as either primary or secondary. A primary deficiency occurs when an
    organism does not get enough of the vitamin in its food. A secondary deficiency may be due to an underlying disorder
    that prevents or limits the absorption or use of the vitamin, due to a "lifestyle factor", such as smoking, excessive
    alcohol consumption, or the use of medications that interfere with the absorption or use of the vitamin.
    People who eat a varied diet are unlikely to develop a severe primary vitamin deficiency, but may be consuming less
     than the recommended amounts; a national food and supplement survey conducted in the US over 2003-2006 reported that
     over 90% of individuals who did not consume vitamin supplements were found to have inadequate levels of some of the
     essential vitamins, notably vitamins D and E.
    <br><br>
    Well-researched human vitamin deficiencies involve thiamine (beriberi), niacin (pellagra),vitamin C (scurvy),
    folate (neural tube defects) and vitamin D (rickets). In much of the developed world these deficiencies are rare
    due to an adequate supply of food and the addition of vitamins to common foods. In addition to these classical
    vitamin deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of
    different disorders.
    <p style="margin-top:30px;"> <strong>Excess intake</strong><br>
    <mark class="grey">Some vitamins have documented acute or chronic toxicity at larger intakes</mark>, which is referred to as <strong>hypertoxicity</strong>.
    The European Union and the governments of several countries have established Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs)
    for those vitamins which have documented toxicity (see table). The likelihood of consuming too much of
    any vitamin from food is remote, but excessive intake (vitamin poisoning) from dietary supplements does occur.
    In 2016, overdose exposure to all formulations of vitamins and multi-vitamin/mineral formulations was reported
    by 63,931 individuals to the American Association of Poison Control Centers with 72% of these exposures in children
    under the age of five.<mark class="green">In the US, analysis of a national diet and supplement survey reported that about 7%
    of adult supplement users exceeded the UL for folate and 5% of those older than age 50 years exceeded the UL for
    svitamin A.</mark>
