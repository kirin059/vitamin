    <h2 style="font-size:30px;"><strong>On fetal growth and childhood development</strong></h2>
    <p style="margin-top:30px;">Vitamins are essential for the normal growth and development of a multicellular
      organism. Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents, a fetus develops from the nutrients
      it absorbs. It requires certain vitamins and minerals to be present at certain times.
      <mark class="green">These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things, skin, bone, and muscle.</mark>
      If there is serious deficiency in one or more of these nutrients, a child may develop a deficiency disease.
       Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size:30px; margin-top:120px"><strong>On adult health maintenance</strong></h2>
    <p style="margin-top:30px;">Once growth and development are completed, <mark class="grey">vitamins remain essential nutrients
      for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up a multicellular organism</mark>; they also
      enable a multicellular life form <mark class="grey">to efficiently use chemical energy provided by food it eats</mark>, and <mark class="grey">to help process
      the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats required for cellular respiration</mark>.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size:40px; margin-top:80px; margin-bottom:40px;">Functions</h2>
    <p style="margin-top:30px;"><mark class="green";>Vitamins have diverse biochemical functions.</mark> Vitamin A acts as a regulator of cell and tissue growth and differentiation.
      Vitamin D provides a hormone-like function, regulating mineral metabolism for bones and other organs. The B complex vitamins function as enzyme
      cofactors (coenzymes) or the precursors for them. Vitamins C and E function as antioxidants. <mark class="grey";>Both deficient and excess intake of a vitamin can
      potentially cause clinically significant illness</mark>, although excess intake of water-soluble vitamins is less likely to do so.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">Before 1935, the only source of vitamins was from food[citation needed]. If intake of vitamins was lacking,
      the result was vitamin deficiency and consequent deficiency diseases. Then, commercially produced tablets of yeast-extract vitamin B complex
      and semi-synthetic vitamin C became available[citation needed]. This was followed in the 1950s by the mass production and marketing of vitamin
      supplements, including multivitamins, to prevent vitamin deficiencies in the general population. Governments mandated addition of vitamins
      to staple foods such as flour or milk, referred to as food fortification, to prevent deficiencies. Recommendations for folic acid supplementation
      during pregnancy reduced risk of infant neural tube defects.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:20px;">The term vitamin is derived from the word vitamine, which was coined in 1912 by Polish biochemist Casimir Funk,
      who isolated a complex of micronutrients essential to life, all of which he presumed to be amines. When this presumption was later determined
      not to be true, the "e" was dropped from the name. <strong>All vitamins were discovered (identified) between 1913 and 1948</strong></p>
